## Project: Build a Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Navigating a Car in a Simulator

### Overview
The objective of this project is to clone human driving behavior using a Deep Neural Network. In order to achieve this, we are going to use a simple Car Simulator. During the training phase, we navigate our car inside the simulator using the keyboard. While navigating the car the simulator recorded training image and respective steering angles. Then we use those recorded data to train our neural network.
